## The VaR problem:
VaR or value at risk is a quantity that measures the maximum expected loss 
over a given time period at a certain confidence level. For instance, 
if your VaR for a one day time frame at a 95% confidence interval is 
1,000,000 dollars, then you would expect to lose at most 1,000,000 dollars 
in a single day due to random variation.  
## Classical Solution

## Quantum Solution


# Summary 

Your final writeup should include:  

A clear description of the VaR problem and assumptions behind your probability model.
An explanation of your classical Monte Carlo workflow.
A description of your quantum AE/IQAE workflow and bisection search.
Plots comparing accuracy vs number of probability queries.
Sensitivity analysis covering discretization, precision, and confidence levels.
A discussion of:
when quantum methods appear advantageous,
what assumptions enable the advantage,
what aspects are asymptotic vs simulator artifacts.
Creativity is encouraged. Tell a story with your methodology, results, and insights.
