## The VaR problem:



Your final writeup should include:  

A clear description of the VaR problem and assumptions behind your probability model.
An explanation of your classical Monte Carlo workflow.
A description of your quantum AE/IQAE workflow and bisection search.
Plots comparing accuracy vs number of probability queries.
Sensitivity analysis covering discretization, precision, and confidence levels.
A discussion of:
when quantum methods appear advantageous,
what assumptions enable the advantage,
what aspects are asymptotic vs simulator artifacts.
Creativity is encouraged. Tell a story with your methodology, results, and insights.
